Not much going on here - a very basic, watered down project to show some of the capabilities of flask and opencv.

You could use alternatives here - I think Flask is a bit of an overkill in all honesty, but it's the only web server/
application library I knew at the time.

Please, if you mess around with this, or dear god, manage to host this with the help of something like Pinggy . . .
CHANGE THE DEBUG=TRUE TO DEBUG=FALSE.

There are a thousand other security factors you should consider - but letting people run excecutable code on your 
server is numero uno of the 'things not to do in the 21st century'.
